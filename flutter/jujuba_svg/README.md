# Welcome to the JujubaSVG library ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the JujubaSVG library!

jujubaSVG is a user-friendly library for handling SVG files in Flutter applications. It enables granular manipulation of SVG elements - you can access any element by its ID to modify properties like background color, stroke, and other attributes.

## How to use?

Let's say you want to use the library in your `my_beatiful_screen.dart`. You need to 
initialize the controller:

```dart
class MyBeautifulScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final JujubaCommander commander = JujubaCommander();

  //...

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        body: JujubaSVGWidget(
            commander: commander,
            svgText: svgText,
            onElementClick: (nodeInfo) => {},
        ),
    )
//...
```

The library provides a widget called `JujubaSVGWidget`, there you can the `commander`, `svgText`, and `onElementClick`.

- `commander`: allow you to send commands to manipulate the SVG;

- `svgText`: your SVG;

- `onElementClick`: callback to intercept click events in your SVG.
