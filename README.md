# Welcome to the JujubaSVG library ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the jujubaSVG library!

jujubaSVG library is a friendly library to handle SVG files in your Android app. The library allows you to manipulate piece by piece of your SVG. If you have an id for the element, you can access it to change background, stroke, and other things.

---


## How to use? ðŸ¤”

You need to add the following line in your desired `module/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
// ...
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.gabrielbmoro:jujubasvg:<library version>")
    // ...
}
    // ...
```

After that, you need to define at the top level of your composable function the 
`commander` (a friend you will help you to send commands to the library):

```kotlin
@Composable
fun YourComposable() {
    val jujubaCommander = rememberJujubaCommander()
    // ...
}
```

Now you need to declare the Widget responsible to render the SVG file:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun YourComposable() {
    val jujubaCommander = rememberJujubaCommander()

    JujubaSVG(
        svgText = svgText,
        onElementClick = { id ->
            println("ID $id")
            coroutineScope.launch {
                // exemplo of commander
                jujubaCommander.execute(
                    Command.RemoveNode(
                        id
                    )
                )
            }
        },
        commander = jujubaCommander,
    )
}
```

Don't forget the `svgText` should contains all content of your SVG file : )
